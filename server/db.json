In the third installment in the series, young Viking chieftain Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) has to learn that his identity isn’t entirely bound up in Toothless, the dragon partner he befriended in the series’s first installment. Given their deep and satisfying friendship, that sometimes feels like an odd message. Metaphorically speaking, it feels like the movie’s saying that to grow up, people need to let go of their beloved pets. But writer-director Dean DeBlois at least loads the story with visual style and a lot of heartfelt wonder</p><h2></h2>",

      "body": "<p>It’s official: the first uncrewed flight of SpaceX’s new passenger capsule, the Crew Dragon, is set to launch on March 2nd out of Cape Canaveral, Florida. Both NASA and SpaceX agreed to move forward with the flight today after doing a full day of reviews, determining that the vehicle was ready to see space and travel to the International Space Station. If the capsule successfully makes it to orbit, SpaceX will be one crucial step closer to putting the first humans on board its spacecraft.</p><p>This flight, called Demonstration Mission-1, or DM-1, is a major milestone for NASA’s Commercial Crew program, an initiative to send NASA astronauts to the International Space Station aboard private vehicles. Since the Shuttle program ended, NASA has relied on Russia to ferry its astronauts to and from low Earth orbit — an expensive arrangement that limited the types of missions NASA could run. But soon, US astronauts could be launching on US-made vehicles once again, as NASA did during the Space Shuttle era.</p><p>For the program, both SpaceX and rival company Boeing, have been developing new capsules to transport NASA astronauts to and from low Earth orbit. NASA wants the two companies to send these vehicles to space first, empty, before putting people on board. Boeing’s vehicle, the CST-100 Starliner, is set to fly uncrewed for the first time this April. But SpaceX’s Crew Dragon has been at Cape Canaveral since December, ready to fly. SpaceX even tested out the engines on the Falcon 9 rocket it plans to use to carry the capsule to orbit. The company just needed NASA’s approval to make it happen.</p><p>SPACEX IS JUST A WEEK AWAY FROM THE BIG FLIGHT</p><p>NASA tentatively set the March 2nd date a few weeks ago, and now that the okay has been given, SpaceX is just a week away from the big flight. The capsule is set to fly at 2:48AM ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida — an early morning launch time dictated by the International Space Station’s position in orbit. If the Crew Dragon gets off the ground then, it’ll stay in orbit until early morning on Sunday and then attempt to automatically dock with the space station. It will then remain at the ISS for a week before detaching early Friday morning and returning to Earth to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean near Florida.</p><h2></h2>",
